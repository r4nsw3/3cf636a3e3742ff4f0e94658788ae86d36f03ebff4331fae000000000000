  |   Use your alchemic abilities to escape the island in this brutally     |
  |   challenging 2D action-platformer with no checkpoints. You'll get      |
  |   better... eventually.                                                 |

  |   Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment        |
  |   trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing   |
  |   and seemingly cursed Island. Tough but fair combat, responsive        |
  |   controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency   |
  |   panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding,           |
  |   visceral and cathartic action game.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching    |
  |   paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping      |
  |   threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final   |
  |   boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your      |
  |   progress for successive runs; new paths you've unlocked, access to    |
  |   new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.0.2 (v131072)                                  |

  |   - We changed the way the music is loaded in the game, which was       |
  |     causing some lags                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - The camera should no longer go flying off to who knows where if     |
  |     there is a lag                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - We found a few little things that had escaped our bug hunting in    |
  |     the 'outside' levels and fixed them                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - A bunch of other random stuff my developer tells me I'm too         |
  |     jet-lagged to understand                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - You can now choose to lock the game to 30 frames per second, use    |
  |     a pixel font that has proved popular on PC and the daily            |
  |     challenge counter has been fixed                                    |
  |                                                                         |
